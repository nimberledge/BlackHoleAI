# BlackHoleAI

Here is an AI that plays Black Hole against the user. Black Hole is a logic game, played as follows:

1. Fill up the board with all your chips (10 for each player), in increasing number of points for every turn. There are 21 spaces and 20 chips (in total, counting both players), thus there will be an empty space at the end.

2. The last space in the board will be considered a black hole, and the player with the least points sucked in will be the winner. If the points sucked in for both players are equal, it's a tie.

Some points to note:
1. The first player will always play in red, adn the second always in blue.
2. The computer may start the game.
3. PLEASE do not click before the computer has made a move.

Disclaimer: The GUI is definitely not the greatest piece of work I have produced, however I only created it to test the AI. If you try to bend the rules of the game, IT WILL RAISE BUGS, and that will not concern me. 

Finally,
Good luck, and have fun!
